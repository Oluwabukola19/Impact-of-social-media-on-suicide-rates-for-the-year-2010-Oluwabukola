OBSERVATIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS

The rate of suicide across all genders on social media is high, a total of 33.33% twitter users who are male committed suicide in 2010. 29.58% facebook users suicide case was recorded.

In general,the impact of social media in suicide cases has increased over the years,young and old who spend more time on social media are likely to suffer depression which can lead to suicide attempt.




I hereby recommend the following,

1.The team for twitter and facebook should control what their users upload on their account.

2.They should promote healthy contents only.

3.They should create a questionnaire where users input their details, this will serve as a guide to what they see while on their page.

4.Users should also reduce the time they spend on social media.
